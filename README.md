<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Violet Working](screenshot.jpg)](screenshot.jpg)

This is a Python program that uses [SpeechRecognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition) and [pyttsx](https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3) modules to recognize user speech, convert it into text, parse it, and then produce speech output. It simulates the behaviour of a speech assistant.



### Built With
This project is entirely built with the following components and languages:
* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [SpeechRecognition module](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition)
* [pyttsx module](https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3)
* [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI)
